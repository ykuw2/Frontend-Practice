This is a small project that I have completed by going over the JavaScript tutorial online. (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4)

Although I am more of a Data oriented person, with many peers studying Computer Science and pursuing Software Engineering, I wanted to dip my feet into the world of Software Engineering.
I remembered that one of the projects that I have done in my Data Structures class, I was in charge of completing the Frontend (UI) section, which I genuinely enjoyed.
I knew a little bit of HTML and CSS however, I knew that I would need to learn JavaScript if I wanted to tackle on Frontend Development. Thus, is why this project is done. This is my first taste of JavaScript (alongside with HTML and CSS), and I truly enjoyed learning about it.
I still have lots to learn, but I hope this first simple project will be a stepping stone to my Frontend Development, which is part of Software Engineering.
