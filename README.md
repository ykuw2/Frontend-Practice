# Weather App

This is a small project that I have completed by going over a JavaScript tutorial online. (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4)

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while utilizing openweathermap.org's API. By entering a city name, it can give the user the temperature (in °F), humidity, weather, and the corresponding emoji. An example of the usage is shown below.

Although I am more of a Data oriented person, with many peers studying Computer Science and pursuing Software Engineering, I wanted to dip my feet into the world of Software Engineering.
I remembered that one of the projects that I have done in my Data Structures class, I was in charge of completing the Frontend (UI) section, which I genuinely enjoyed.
I knew a little bit of HTML and CSS however, I knew that I would need to learn JavaScript if I wanted to tackle on Frontend Development. Thus, is why this project is done. This is my first taste of JavaScript (alongside with HTML and CSS), and I truly enjoyed learning about it.
I still have lots to learn, but I hope this first simple project will be a stepping stone to my Frontend Development (which is part of Software Engineering!).

P.S. I also learned some basics of git. I hope to improve my skills and knowledge about git and be able to push code normally when coding.
